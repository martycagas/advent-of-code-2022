# Advent of Code 2022

This is my repository for sharing my Advent of Code 2022 puzzle solutions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some of the solution scripts require at least [Python 3.12](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.12.html).

## What is the Advent of Code?

[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about) is an [annual](https://adventofcode.com/2022/events) coding challenge. It consists of 25 challenges, one released each day until the Christmas day. Everyone's welcome to join and compete with others on the [global](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard) or private leaderboards in solving the challenges as fast as possible - or just hone their programming skills by doing something fun.

Oh, and they can also be completed in any language you'd like.

## Do you compete?

No. My schedule doesn't really allow me to, sadly.

## Why Python?

I don't get to write much code in Python as part of my work or other hobby projects and it's one of the languages I'd like to practice more.

## Your code is horrible!

Why, thank you!

No, but seriously... it's on purpose.

## ... why?

When I write code for work--or any code, really--I put a lot of effort into it being readable and clean. That means I never really make use of the more esoteric constructs in languages, such as lambdas, list comprehension in Python, etc. - since all of them can be written in some different, maybe more verbose, but certainly easier to understand way.

While I stand by the fact that these constructs are best left unused in most cases, it also means I never really get to practice with them--and recently I've noticed that translates to a severe lack of skill understanding them when used by someone else.

And also, I realised I can have these challenges be an outlet for my sadistic desires, writing terrible code that I would otherwise rethink and rewrite. That's why also ended up removing and not writing any comments. Let's see how terrible my code can get before I go insane trying to debug the things I myself wrote 5 minutes ago.
