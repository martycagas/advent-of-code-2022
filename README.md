# Advent of Code 2022

This is my repository for sharing my Advent of Code 2022 puzzle solutions.

## What is the Advent of Code?

[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about) is an [annual](https://adventofcode.com/2022/events) coding challenge. It consists of 25 challenges, one released each day until the Christmas day. Everyone's welcome to join and compete with others on the [global](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard) or private leaderboards in solving the challenges as fast as possible - or just hone their programming skills by doing something fun.

Oh, and they can also be completed in any language you'd like.

## Do you compete?

No. My schedule doesn't really allow me to, sadly.

## Why Python?

I don't get to write much code in Python as part of my work or other hobby projects and it's one of the languages I'd like to practice more.
